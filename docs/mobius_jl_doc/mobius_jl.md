# mobius.jl

mobius.jl is a package for the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). It has similar functionality to [mobipy](../mobipydocs/mobipy.html).

This package is currently not fully featured, but allows you to run a model and extract result series.

See [an example here](https://github.com/NIVANorge/Mobius2/blob/main/mobius_jl/test.ipynb).
