# mobius.jl

mobius.jl is a package for the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). It has similar functionality to [mobipy](../mobipydocs/mobipy.html).

This package is currently not fully featured, but allows you to run a model and extract result series.

See [an example here](https://github.com/NIVANorge/Mobius2/blob/main/example_notebooks/basic_julia.ipynb).

To use mobius.jl you need to first follow the installation procedure for mobipy, that is you need to download mobipy/c_abi.dll from ftp://mobiserver.niva.no/Mobius2 and put it in your local Mobius2/mobipy folder.
