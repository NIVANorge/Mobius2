# The Guide

Don't panic!

This guide will lead you through the process of building a model from the first steps to more advanced concepts.

It will explain the most important features of Mobius2, but will not cover all details. For that, see the [declaration format documentation](declaration_format.html) and related pages. It is also useful to read about the [central concepts](central_concepts.html).

A good complement to the guide is to read the code of [existing modules and models](https://github.com/NIVANorge/Mobius2/tree/main/models), starting with something simple like SimplyQ.

**The guide is not yet complete. More chapters will appear.**

Planned next chapters:
- Distribution and aggregation
- Dissolved quantites
- Graph connections
- (more)
