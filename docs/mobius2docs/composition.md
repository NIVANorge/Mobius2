# Model composition

This document will loosely describe how the framework takes a declared model and puts it together to a runnable program. All of this is automatic, so you don't need to understand it if you only want to build or use models.

This document is yet to be written. The guide is prioritized for now.

## Instruction sorting

## Solver assignment

## Batch creation and batch function compilation

## Memory layout
