# MAGIC

MAGIC is the Model of Acidification of Groundwater In Catchments.

This refers to the Mobius2 implementation. There are earlier implementations in FORTRAN by Bernard J. Cosby. The FORTRAN MAGIC v7 model was described in \[Cosby01\].

In the Mobius2 version the core ion balance model is mathematically identical to the one in MAGIC v7 and MAGIC v8, but in Mobius2 it is now possible for users to make their own additions and modifications to the mass balance transport and biogeochemical processes.

A more detailed description may appear here later.
