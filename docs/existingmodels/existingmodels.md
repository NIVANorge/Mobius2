# Existing models

The Mobius2 framework comes with several existing modules and models that can be used directly or modified to accomodate new research questions. These include

- The [Simply family](simply.html). This is a family of catchment models building on the hydrology model SimplyQ. Modules for nutrients and contaminants exist.
- [EasyLake](easylake.html). This is a simple 2-box lake model that is intended for inclusion into a larger catcment model. It predicts residence time, temperature and ice in the lake, and has modules for nutrients retention and contaminants.
- [NIVAFjord](nivafjord.html). This is a 1-dimensional layered basin model that can be used to model e.g. fjords, lagoons and lakes. It has biochemistry modules for nutrients, phytoplankton and sediments.

If desired, the above models can be coupled together into a full catchment to coast system.

In addition to these, Mobius2 comes with modules for other processes such as
- Snow pack and melt
- Evapotranspiration
- Atmospheric variables (radiation, humidity...)
- Air-sea heat exchange

These are convenient to include into larger models.
