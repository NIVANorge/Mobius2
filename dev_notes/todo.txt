	*****   First pri:
		connection fluxes of dissolvedes seem to add to the base substance rather than the dissolved substance.
	

	Override declarations.

	Relative paths are always relative to the model source file, but this breaks when you do extend_model of a model from another folder.
	Same when including a library from another library...
	
	
	
	Make variables of type Source_Location be named source_loc consistently to not confuse with other things.
	
	Do proper memory management for Math_Expr_FT. The current system is becoming unbearable, and quickly leads to leaks or double deletes.
	
	Make it automatic that certain state variables are on solvers (dissolveds etc)
	
	Clean up the State_Variable and Model_Instruction structs to make it less easy to have usage errors (maybe make accessors).
	
	
	


	Let declarations in inlined modules be visible in the parent model scope (?)
	
	Processes not specified per compartment / quantity. Can be attached to those.
		- something like compartment_type etc.
		- have to figure out what to do with duplicates of par_group etc. - ties into name system.
	
	Interchangable components for connections.
		lake vs. river
		
		- begin with simple or more full-scale complicated system?
		
	Allow redeclaration of constants without conflict (?)

	Move to std::string instead of String_View in path_utils.. (if possible, had a problem with it before).
	
	
	
	
	
	
		
		
	DONE:
	
	Make and test a SimplyTox    (partial at least)
	
	Index set distribution of quantities
		+ par groups on quantities
		
	Probably only allow connection fluxes between state variables that are on solvers. (Currently set to be the default)
