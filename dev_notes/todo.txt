	#First pri: Fix if_chains so that they don't need the else clause
	#	- first fix in prune_tree
	#	- then in llvm_jit and emulate
	
	Here is the issue!!: See line 201 of model_compilation.
	
	
	
	Make variables of type Source_Location be named source_loc consistently to not confuse with other things.
	
	Do proper memory management for Math_Expr_FT. The current system is becoming unbearable, and quickly leads to leaks or nullpointer dereferences.
	
	Make it automatic that certain state variables are on solvers (dissolveds etc)
	
	Probably only allow connection fluxes between state variables that are on solvers.
	
	Clean up the State_Variable and Model_Instruction structs to make it less easy to have usage errors.
	
	
	

	
	Processes not specified per compartment / quantity. Can be attached to those.
		- something like compartment_type etc.
		- have to figure out what to do with duplicates of par_group etc. - ties into name system.
	
	Interchangable components for connections.
		lake vs. river
		
		- begin with simple or more full-scale complicated system?
		
		
		
		
		
	DONE:
	
	Make and test a SimplyTox    (partial at least)
	
	Index set distribution of quantities
		+ par groups on quantities
