	

	Override declarations.

	Relative paths are always relative to the model source file, but this breaks when you do extend_model of a model from another folder.
	Same when including a library from another library...
	
	Allow redeclaration of constants without conflict (?)
	
	
	
	Make variables of type Source_Location be named source_loc consistently to not confuse with other things.
	
	Do proper memory management for Math_Expr_FT. The current system is becoming unbearable, and quickly leads to leaks or nullpointer dereferences/frees.
	
	Make it automatic that certain state variables are on solvers (dissolveds etc)
	
	Clean up the State_Variable and Model_Instruction structs to make it less easy to have usage errors (maybe make accessors).
	
	
	

	
	Processes not specified per compartment / quantity. Can be attached to those.
		- something like compartment_type etc.
		- have to figure out what to do with duplicates of par_group etc. - ties into name system.
	
	Interchangable components for connections.
		lake vs. river
		
		- begin with simple or more full-scale complicated system?
		
		
		
		
		
	DONE:
	
	Make and test a SimplyTox    (partial at least)
	
	Index set distribution of quantities
		+ par groups on quantities
		
	Probably only allow connection fluxes between state variables that are on solvers. (Currently set to be the default)
